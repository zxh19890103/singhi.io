How did I fall in love with a woman like her?

A woman like herâ€”

She sleeps during the day and awakens in the night,
always maintaining a seductive posture.
From her attire to her expressions, she exudes an irresistible allure.
She is the object of countless men's desires.

In dimly lit rooms,
the gazes, hands, and even degrading words of men freely invade her body and space.
Her breasts, thighs, and even her most private areas
seem to become the targets of those men's indulgence.
Some press her down, rendering her immobile,
while others disassemble her with their eyes,
seeking only fleeting satisfaction.

To her,
this is both ordinary and extraordinary.
She tells herself she's merely using her body to earn a bit of money,
enough to satisfy her daily expenses.
She's grown used to it, perhaps even deriving a touch of enjoyment from it,
yet beneath it all lies a thread of helplessness.
To her, men are just another species,
one willing to spend generously in pursuit of lust.
She accommodates them, endures them,
because the hardships of life and her own desires leave her with no other choice.

Yet, she is still a woman,
though her heart seems to have grown indifferent and unrestrained.

If a man loved her, would she be moved?
Perhaps she would, or perhaps she wouldn't.
More often than not, what she cares about is the material support a man can offer her.
And what she can give in return
is only the beauty of her body and a brief distraction from boredom.

Perhaps, her life is destined to continue in this way.
She doesn't seem to be someone who can truly be loved.
