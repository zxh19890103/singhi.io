short: Brief introduction to the graphic library I designed and developed at Hairobotics for visualization purposes in the warehousing industry.

I wasn't satisfied with the code structure of the [editor](./the-editor-intro-en), so I reorganized it and created a graphic library tailored for warehouse visualization, naming it "wik," which stands for "Warehouse Visualization Quickly."

I've provided a publicly accessible online documentation that you can visit at the following link:

[Wik, Warehouse Digitalization](https://wik.zhangxinghai.cn)

This documentation provides detailed instructions on how to use wik, along with the underlying design principles and implementation approach.

The documentation will be continuously updated! If you're interested in the field of web image rendering, feel free to contact me to collaborate on maintaining this project or exploring its potential commercial value.
