So far, what has she done for me?  

Her biggest "sacrifice" might just be her body.  

She doesn't love me, nor does she want to. She simply feels grateful to me, that's all. She doesn’t really want to see me. Her so-called "wanting to see me" is just to have me buy her time so she can take a break.  

She bought me a pair of pants worth about 180 yuan, a pair of shoes for 200 yuan, and a black sweater that sheds terribly, costing around 100 to 200 yuan. She probably thinks I can’t see through her tricks, but in fact, I am perfectly aware.  

She takes me shopping, but it’s only for me to pay. This has already happened twice. Could this be considered being taken advantage of? In some sense, yes. She’s quite skillful, playing with my emotions. She pretends to mind me being with other massage therapists, but does she really care? Not at all. She’s only afraid I might damage her reputation.  

She invited me to her apartment, claiming it was the greatest trust she could give me. But how much is that trust worth? It’s nothing more than her thinking I’m easier to manipulate.  

I show my reluctance to leave her, and she uses that to control me, making me give even more.  

Where is any sign of her wanting to see me?  

None. Not even the slightest.  

Her tears are just her mask, showcasing vulnerability and grievance in front of men. She talks about buying her own time to rest, knowing full well I won’t let her do that.  

She threatens to end things with me. What if I agreed?  

I am already planning to part ways with her.  

She doesn’t need to bring it up again.  

Her so-called "darling" is nothing but an insult to me. In her heart, I am not her "darling" at all.  

She is exceptionally cunning, exceptionally shrewd, and exceptionally devoid of morality or love. All she does is toy with emotions because she doesn’t have any herself.  

She meets numerous male clients daily and doesn’t care about me at all. She can derive physical satisfaction from other clients. I used to be oblivious, but now I understand—when she’s massaging other men, she might even feel joy. She wouldn’t mind their roughness; she might even like it more.  

When I told her to rest and didn’t intend to visit her, she didn’t want to see me. Only when I mentioned letting her buy her time off did she realize I was willing to pay for her to rest. That’s why she hasn’t responded to me at all.  

Otherwise, she would’ve said, “I want to see you,” inviting me over to accompany her, which would mean spending money. That’s the reality.  

She doesn’t care anymore.  

And now, I’ve come to terms with it.  

I’ve already given up on this relationship in my heart.  

And I won’t say it outright.  

From now on, I won’t see her ever again. Never!  

Believe me, she’s not a good person.  

She has no feelings, no love, and no place for me in her heart.  

This is the whole truth!
