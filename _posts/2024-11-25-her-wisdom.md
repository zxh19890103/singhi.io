She has been working in the foot massage industry for over four years and has gained extensive experience, particularly in dealing with various types of male clients.

At first, she didn’t know how to interact with customers. When faced with rude behavior, she felt helpless, often crying alone at night and even thinking about giving up.

Many times, she encountered wealthy men who wanted her to be their mistress, thrill-seekers who hinted at inappropriate intentions, or older men who offered to support her financially. She said she couldn’t accept such “undeserved fortune” and thus rejected all these temptations.

However, she said my presence felt different to her. She feels very relaxed when she’s with me because I respect her. This became the main reason she accepted me. But I wonder, perhaps it’s because she feels a lot of pressure and disrespect when she’s with other clients.

She told me that most male clients in foot massage parlors lack respect for the therapists, viewing them as mere servants who must obey their wishes. They think they can touch the therapist however they please or even insult them verbally. The therapists must endure it or learn to handle it skillfully. To be treated like an ordinary person, she has to patiently chat with the clients, gradually building a subtle rapport.

She said that therapists are also human. They have loved, had families, and hoped for genuine affection. However, because they lack other skills to survive in the city, they turn to this industry. For them, this might be the best option as long as they don’t engage in anything illicit. She emphasized that she cannot accept offering “half-service” or “full-service” and feels afraid of doing home visits.

Her material desires aren’t high. She seeks a comfortable and carefree life, as long as she doesn’t have to worry about her next meal. She’s content with being able to buy clothes and makeup she likes. This lifestyle satisfies her, at least for now.

However, now that I’ve entered her life, her work makes me feel uneasy. She said that if I cannot provide financial support for her to leave the industry, she has no choice but to continue, and I must endure this reality. She assured me that it’s just work, and she will maintain boundaries with other clients. Even if she’s booked for outside appointments, she will keep a safe distance. She also has to add many male clients on WeChat and frequently chat with them to attract repeat customers. These are all things I must accept.

Can I accept this?

She mentioned that if I sought massage services from other therapists, especially “soft-style” massages, she wouldn’t be able to tolerate it. Thinking about me being intimate with another therapist would cause her immense pain, and if she found out, she would immediately end our relationship. However, how could I not feel equally pained when she’s physically close with other men during her work? My pain is no less than hers. She explained that this is just her job—she sells her looks, companionship, and time. Once the time is over, everything ends, and there are no extra feelings involved.
