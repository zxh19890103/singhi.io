I loved her—truly, deeply, and absolutely. But I cannot feel her love for me. Perhaps the problem lies within me. Undoubtedly, it might just be my own issue.

I gave her money, not directly but by buying things for her. She accepted them without expressing gratitude because, as she said, she is already my girlfriend. Is that the point?

She considers herself my girlfriend, so I should provide for her without hesitation. But then, what does she do for me? Offer her body? Yet her body is accessible to any man willing to pay. I paid, too. So, what makes our connection any different?

I’m struggling to understand. How do I love her? By paying her bills? She says her presence and her smile are expressions of her love for me. But is that really enough?

I don’t understand.
