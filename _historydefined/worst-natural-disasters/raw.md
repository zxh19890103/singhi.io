Natural disasters can be one of the most terrifying phenomenons we experience. It makes us face the fact that humans sometimes stand no chance in the face of such powerful forces.

From earthquakes to floods to tornadoes and volcanoes, natural disasters have been occurring alongside humans for as long as we have been around and will continue to occur after we are gone.

Let’s take a look at some of the most powerful and destruction natural disasters in recent history.

## 2010 Haiti Earthquake

Over 220,000 people lost their lives in the 7.0 magnitude earthquake that hit Haiti in 2010. The epicenter was 25 miles from the capital, which was also very densely populated. There were an additional 52 aftershocks in the following weeks.

Haiti’s infrastructure was not strong enough to withstand the earthquake of this magnitude. This resulted in the collapse and destruction of over 30,000 commercial buildings and over 250,000 residences.

## 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunami

A 9.2 magnitude earthquake struck off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia in December 2004. This was the most powerful earthquake of the 21st century. This created a massive tsunami that reached over 100 feet high.

When this wave made contact with land, the destruction was enormous. An estimated 227,898 people lost their lives in 14 countries.

## 2019-2020 Australian Bush Fires

In 2019, a series of fires started across Australia that grew into one of the most catastrophic fires seasons on record. The fires started in Central Queensland and began to spread across the continent. This was mainly due to the excessive dry conditions and low moisture in the soil.

It was catastrophic on the environment, especially the animals. Some experts believe that some endangered species were driven to extinction because of this. The fires were not extinguished completely until early the following year.

## 1902 Eruption of Mount Pelée

Eruptive activity began on April 23rd at Mount Pelée off the island of Martinique in the eastern Caribbean. There was a brief pause in the rumblings until May 8th. A gigantic eruption occurred at 8:00 AM.

The lava flow began moving at such a fast speed that it made escape impossible. It reached the city of Saint-Pierre within 2 minutes, taking the lives of virtually all of its 28,000 residents and destroying the town.
