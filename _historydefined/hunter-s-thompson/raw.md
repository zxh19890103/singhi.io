# The Life and Strange Times of Writer Hunter S. Thompson

By [James R. Coffey](https://www.historydefined.net/author/jamesrcoffey/ "View all posts by James R. Coffey")

In June of 1970, journalist Hunter S. Thompson was sent to his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, to cover the highlights of the world-famous _Kentucky Derby,_ for _Scanlan’s Monthly._ The result was a now infamous article entitled, “The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved.” 

Virtually ignoring the race itself, Thompson focused instead on the orgy-like atmosphere– “thousands of people fainting, crying, copulating, trampling each other and fighting with broken whiskey bottles”– surrounding the event. 

Writing in “first person,” Thompson set the carnage against the backdrop of the current American political scene: President Richard Nixon had ordered the bombing of Cambodia, and four students had been killed by _Ohio National Guardsmen_ at _Kent State University_ just two days later. 

Though blatantly disregarding the task assigned (and running up an exorbitant liquor and food bill at his hotel), “The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved” is considered one of the most significant sports articles of the 1970’s, and more importantly, marked the birth of what has become known as “gonzo journalism” (a style of reporting in first person, making no claims of objectivity, the reporter being part of the story). 

While this article doesn’t define Thompson–or even represent his impressive body of work–it marks a turning point (perhaps, breaking point) for one of the most brilliant, prolific, original, and fearless writers of the past century.

## Early Life

Hunter Stockton Thompson was born in Louisville, Kentucky, on July 18, 1937, the first of three sons born to Jack Robert Thompson (an insurance adjuster) and Virginia Davison Ray (head librarian at the _Louisville Free Public Library_).

In December of 1943, when Thompson was six years old, his family moved to the historic neighborhood of Cherokee Triangle in the upscale area of _The Highlands_, in Louisville; becoming neighbors of future mystery novelist, Sue Grafton.

Though from an early age Thompson displayed natural athletic abilities, his disdain for authority–even as a boy—deterred any aspirations of participating in organized sports. Turning his attention instead to the written word, Thompson became an avid reader, soon discovering the early works of counter-culture icon Jack Keuroac, and later, J.P. Donleavy.

On July 3, 1952, when Thompson was 14, his father died of _myasthenia gravis_ (a neuromuscular disease) at just 58 years of age. From that time on, Thompson and his brothers were raised solely by their mother, Virginia, living on her librarian’s salary. 

Soon after her husband’s death, Virginia began drinking heavily. 

## Education

At about six years of age, Thompson attended  _I.N. Bloom Elementary School_ where, despite his dislike for authority, co-founded the _Hawks Athletic Club_ (and by some accounts, sometimes participated). This led to an invitation to join Louisville’s _Castlewood Athletic Club,_ an organization that prepared young boys for high school sports. (Thompson, of course, didn’t accept.) 

In 1951, Thompson temporarily attended _Atherton High School_, before transferring in the fall of 1952 to _Louisville Male High School_. That same year, he was admitted to the prestigious _Athenaeum Literary Association_, a school-sponsored literary social club founded 1862. (Its members—all from Louisville’s upper-crust–included Porter Bibb, future publisher of _Rolling Stone_ magazine.)

As an _Athenaeum_ member, Thompson contributed articles and worked on the club’s yearbook, _The Spectator_;until 1955, when he was summarily ejected for criminal activity. Having been in the car driven my the perpetrator, Thompson was charged as an accessory to robbery and sentenced to 60 days in Kentucky’s _Jefferson County Jail_. 

Released after serving 31 days, Thompson was barred from taking final exams, preventing his graduation.

## Military Service

In reaction to the punishment received from _Louisville Male High School_, Thompson did the unexpected: he enlisted in the _United States Air Force_. 

Once completing basic training at _Lackland Air Force Base_, in San Antonio, Texas, Thompson was transferred to _Scott Air Force Base_, in Belleville, Illinois, where he studied electronics. (He applied to flight school, but was rejected.)

In 1956, Thompson was transferred to _Eglin Air Force Base_, near Fort Walton Beach, Florida, where he took night classes at _Florida State University_. Subsequently landing his first professional writing job, Thompson was made sports editor of _Eglin’s_, _Command Courier_ (a job he ultimately got by lying about his job experience). As editor, Thompson traveled the US with the _Eglin Eagles_ football team, reporting on their games.

In 1957, Thompson began writing a sports column for _The Playground News_, a local newspaper published in Fort Walton Beach, Florida; but received no byline as _Air Force_ regulations forbade outside employment.

By 1958, Thompson’s natural contempt for authority paid off when his commanding officer recommended him for an early honorable discharge, stating, “Airman First Class Thompson, although talented, will not be guided by policy. Sometimes his rebel and superior attitude seems to rub off on other airmen staff members.”

## Early Career

By the end of 1958, Thompson was working as sports editor for a small newspaper in Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania, before relocating to New York City. 

There he audited courses at the _Columbia University School of General Studies_, during which time he worked as a copy boy at _Time_ for $51 a week. (While employed at _Time_, Thompson typed out sections of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s _The Great Gatsby_ and Ernest Hemingway’s _A Farewell to Arms_ in order to learn their writing styles.) After a year, _Time_ fired him for insubordination.

Hired and fired as a reporter for _The Middletown Daily Record_ in Middletown, New York, in 1960, Thompson moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico, landing a job writing for the sports magazine _El Sportivo—_which folded shortly after he arrived. He then applied–and was turned down–for a job at the Puerto Rican English-language daily _The San Juan Star_.

With no contractual writing work available, Thompson opted to became a stringer (a freelance writer working on speculation) for the _New York Herald Tribune_ and a few other US papers; while trying to make a name for himself.

Returning to the US in 1961, Thompson visited San Francisco and eventually lucked into a living/caretaker arrangement in Big Sur, and spent the next eight months at the 375-acre _Murphy Ranch._ During this period, Big Sur was a “Beat” (Beatnik) haven for writers such as Henry Miller (_Tropic of Cancer_) and screenwriter Dennis Murphy (_The Sergeant_)–both of whom Thompson admired. 

In the fall of 1961, Thompson had his first feature magazine article published in _Playboy_ competitor,  _Rogue_ magazine, an over-view of the artisan and bohemian culture of Big Sur; as well as his first piece of fiction, “Burial at Sea.” 

In late 1961, Thompson began work on his first novel, _The Rum Diary_ (which was finally published in 1998 and adapted as a motion picture in 2011).

In May of 1962, Thompson relocated to South America where for the next year worked as a correspondent for the _Dow Jones_\-owned weekly paper, the _National Observer;_ a publication he would contribute to for the remainder of the decade. While in Brazil, Thompson also worked for the Rio de Janeiro-based _Brazil Herald_, the country’s only English-language daily paper. 

## Marriage, Drugs, Hell’s Angels

While writing for both the _Observer_ and the _Herald,_ Thompson’s longtime girlfriend, Sandra Dawn Conklin, joined him in Rio. Returning to the US a short time later, the couple married on May 19, 1963, and after living briefly in Aspen, Colorado, relocated to Glen Ellen, California. Their son, Juan Fitzgerald Thompson, was born in March of 1964.

That summer, Thompson began experimenting with Dexedrine (a powerful amphetamine)commonly referred to as “speed.” Thompson used Dexedrine for the next decade to influence his writing; after which he began using cocaine. 

In 1965, after the _Observer_ refused to print his review of Tom Wolfe’s 1965 book of essays, _The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby_, Thompson began writing for the _Berkeley Underground Press_, contributing articles to the _Spide—_while immersing himself in the local drug and hippie counter-culture.

That same year, Carey McWilliams, editor of the politiocultural publication _The Nation_, contracted Thompson to write an exposé about the _Hell’s Angels_ motorcycle club (gang) based in California. (At the time, Thompson was living near San Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury District, where the Angels were headquartered.)

The _Angels_ article appeared in the May 17th, 1965 issue of _The Nation_, after which Thompson received numerous book deals–while he spent the next year living and riding with the _Angels._ 

The relationship with the gang went sour, however, when they realized that Thompson was exploiting them for financial gain–and demanded their share. An argument ensued, resulting in Thompson receiving a sever beating (“stomping” in _Angels_ vernacular). 

In 1966, when _Random House_ published the hard cover of _Hell’s Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs_, the dispute between Thompson and the gang was further exploited when _CBC Television_ broadcast a face-to-face between Thompson and _Hell’s Angel_ leader Skip Workman–before a live studio audience. 

In the _New York Times_ review of the book, it praised it as an “angry, knowledgeable, fascinating, and excitedly written book” that portrays the _Hell’s Angels_ “not so much as dropouts from society but as total misfits, or unfits—emotionally, intellectually and educationally unfit to achieve the rewards, such as they are, that the contemporary social order offers.” Thompson himself was lauded as a “spirited, witty, observant, and original writer; his prose crackles like motorcycle exhaust.”  

## Fame

Following the wide-spread (and unexpected) success of the _Hell’s Angels_, Thompson’s writing was suddenly in great demand; his work published in several national magazines including, _Harper’s_, _The New York Times_ _Magazine_, _Pageant_, and _Esquire_.

In 1967, shortly before the so-called “Summer of Love” was gearing-up in the Haight-Ashbury District of San Francisco, Thompson wrote a scathing piece for _The New York Times Magazine_ called, “The ‘Hashbury’ is the Capital of the Hippies,” in which he criticized San Francisco’s hippie sector as “devoid of both the political convictions of the New Left and the artistic core of the Beats,” resulting in a “culture overrun with young people spending their time in the pursuit of drugs.” He concluded, “The thrust is no longer for ‘change’ or ‘progress’ or ‘revolution’ but merely to escape, to live on the far perimeter of a world that might have been–perhaps should have been–and strike a bargain for survival on purely personal terms.”

Disenchanted with the hippie “scene,” late in 1967, Thompson moved his family back to Colorado, renting a house in a small mountain hamlet outside Aspen called, Woody Creek. 

In early 1968, Thompson joined a number of prominent writers (including Allen Ginsberg, Grace Paley, Frances Fox Piven, and Kurt Vonnegut) in signing the “Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” pledge, refusing to pay income tax, in [protest of the Vietnam War.](https://www.historydefined.net/unforgettable-images-from-the-vietnam-war/ "The most unforgettable images from the Vietnam War")

That same year, Thompson used a $6,000 advance from _Random House_ to travel the country covering the 1968 US presidential election and attend the _Democratic National Convention_ in Chicago–collecting material. After witnessing repeated clashes between police and anti-war protesters, he stated, “I went to the Democratic Convention as a journalist and returned a raving beast.”

In early 1969, Thompson received a $15,000 royalty check for the paperback sales of the _Hell’s Angels,_ part of which he used as down payment on the property where he would live for the remainder of his life; a 110-acre piece of land with a house he dubbed, “Owl Farm.” 

In December of that year, Thompson contacted _Rolling Stone_ editor, Jann Wenner, to compliment the magazine’s coverage of the disastrous “Altamont Free Concert,” during which four concert-goers were killed. Wenner responded with an invitation for Thompson to submit his work to the magazine, which soon after became Thompson’s primary writing outlet.

## The Early 1970s, Politics, Fear and Loathing

Now a household name, Thompson used his celebrity to pursue a number of interests including a bid for Sheriff of Pitkin County, Colorado, as part of a cadre of local residents seeking local offices on the “Freak Power” ticket; his primary platform, decriminalizing drugs. (Thompson lost.) 

Following the notoriety of the article, “The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved” in 1970, Thompson began research on the story that would ultimately bring him the most acclaim: “Strange Rumblings in Aztlan,” an exposé on the 1970 killing of Mexican-American television journalist Rubén Salazar, shot in the head at close range with a tear-gas canister by officers of the _Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department_ during the “National Chicano Moratorium March” protesting the Vietnam War.

While developing the story, Thompson and prominent Mexican-American activist/attorney Oscar Zeta Acosta traveled to Las Vegas to attend a drug enforcement conference; the resulting story published in _Rolling Stone_ in April of 1971. This and a subsequent trip to Vegas then became the basis for his book, _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_, which _Rolling Stone_ serialized in two parts in November of 1971, and _Random House_ published in book form the following year. 

Written in first-person by a fictional journalist named “Raoul Duke” (accompanied by “Dr. Gonzo,” his “300-pound Samoan attorney”), the book essentially reflects Thompson’s own angst at coming to terms with the failure of the 1960s counter-cultural movement. Met with considerable critical acclaim, _The New York Times_ praised it as “the best book yet written on the decade of dope.” 

More importantly, it introduced Thompson’s “Gonzo” journalism style to a much wider readership.

In 1971, _Stone_ editor, Jann Wenner, assigned Thompson to cover the 1972 US presidential election, paying him a $1,000 per month retainer, and providing him a house in Washington DC; the result of which were a series of popular “Fear and Loathing” articles. (He was also offered a deal to publish a post-campaign book, which later appeared as, _Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail ’71._) 

The articles, and later, the book, were praised for breaking new boundaries in political journalism, with literary critic Morris Dickstein writing, “\[Thompson\] had learned to approximate the effect of mind-blasting drugs in his prose style . . . He recorded the nuts and bolts of a presidential campaign with all the contempt and incredulity that other reporters must feel but censor out.”

## Falling From Grace

For the next three years, as one of the most popular and in-demand writers in the Western Hemisphere, Hunter S. Thompson could do no wrong. 

But soon after returning from Africa covering the “Rumble in the Jungle”–the world heavyweight boxing match between George Foreman and Muhammad Ali in 1974 (which he was too drunk to attend and never bothered to file a story)–Thompson’s writing and reputation fell into serious decline.

In 1975, Wenner sent Thompson to Vietnam to cover the final hours of the Vietnam War–but he arrived in Saigon just as South Vietnam was collapsing and the other journalists were fleeing the country. The following year, Thompson was scheduled to cover the ’76 presidential campaign (and produce a book), but Wenner had such doubts about Thompson’s commitment that he canceled it.  As a result, Thompson’s primary literary output for the remainder of the decade was the first of a four-volume series of books titled _The Gonzo Papers_ (beginning with _The Great Shark Hunt,_ in 1979; ending with _Better Than Sex,_ in 1994).

After 1980, Thompson produced less work, and aside from a few paid appearances, kept to his compound in Woody Creek. Despite the drop-off in contributions, Wenner kept Thompson on the _Rolling Stone_ masthead as chief of the “National Affairs Desk” (and did so until Thompson’s death). 

In 1980, Thompson divorced his wife, Sandra Conklin-Thompson, and later that year, relocated to Hawaii to write, _The Curse of Lono_, a Gonzo-style account of the 1980 _Honolulu Marathon_. The book when completed, however, was poorly received and didn’t sell; the editor calling it “disorganized and incoherent.”

Although Thompson continued to occasionally feed his _Rolling Stone_ readers, he effectively sabotaged what remained of his reputation by submitting tasteless, often incoherent gibberish, when provided other writing opportunities. 

(Thompson published these articles as _Gonzo Papers, Vol. 2: Generation of Swine: Tales of Shame and Degradation in the ’80s_ \[in 1988\] and _Gonzo Papers, Vol. 3: Songs of the Doomed: More Notes on the Death of the American Dream_ \[in 1990\].)

## Final years

For the remaining 15 years of his life, Thompson lived as a recluse—while still managing to garner attention. 

In March of 1990, Thompson faced sexual assault charges when former porn film director Gail Palmer claimed that after she rebuffed his sexual advances while visiting his home, Thompson threw a drink at her and twisted her left breast. After a police search of his home, Thompson was charged with five felonies and three misdemeanors (relating to drug possession). Two months later, the charges were dropped.

Throughout the 1990s, Thompson claimed to be working on a novel titled, _Polo Is My Life;_ intended to be Thompson’s last major work. Although fragments of the book were excerpted in _Rolling Stone,_ the completed novel never materialized.

Aside from a scathing obituary of Richard Nixon called “He Was a Crook,” published in 1994, Thompson’s only other notable work from this time was his final _Rolling Stone_ feature, “The Fun-Hogs in the Passing Lane: Fear and Loathing, Campaign 2004,” a brief account of the 2004 presidential election.

Between 2003 and 2005, Thompson published his final collection, _Kingdom of Fear: Loathsome Secrets of a Star-Crossed Child in the Final Days of the American Century_ (publicized as Thompson’s memoir). 

Bringing his career full circle, between 2000 and 2005, Thompson wrote a weekly column for _ESPN.com’s_ Page 2, called, “Hey, Rube.” (In 2004, _Simon & Schuster_ published a collection of these columns titled, _Hey Rube: Blood Sport, the Bush Doctrine, and the Downward Spiral of Dumbness._)

On April 23, 2003, Thompson married his assistant, Anita Bejmuk. 

## The Final Frontier

On February 20, 2005 at 5:42 pm, Hunter Stockton Thompson shot himself in the head at “Owl Farm,” while speaking to his wife on the telephone. 

Per his wishes, his body was cremated. 

On August 20, 2005 (also per his wishes), in a private funeral funded by actor Johnny Depp,  Thompson’s ashes were fired into the sky from a cannon, while Norman Greenbaum’s “Spirit in the Sky” played.
